# Life Manager

Life Manager is a web app to help you manage your life!

Powered by ReactJS, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and Tailwindcss.

Keep tasks easy and simple with a full frontend to manage your assignments. Note: You must have docker and docker compose installed.
To start, run 

`git clone https://github.com/mzeng1417/LifeMR.git && cd LifeMR`

`docker compose up -d` 

to gain a working app.

We are planning to add many features next, such as direct integration with Canvas LMS, Infinite Campus, and others for managing all grades, assignments, and whatever all in one place.

In addition, we will provide a cloud offering soon. Because our project under AGPL, allows you to provide it yourself to compete with us. If you make it better and beat us, congrats! As long as you keep the codebase for this app open source, we have no objections.
